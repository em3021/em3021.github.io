													<p>THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. MY GOODNESS, THAT'S THAT WAS A WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE SO MANY HAIRSTYLES. IT IS WONDERFUL BEING WITH YOU TONIGHT. I HAVE TO SAY I'M STILL IN THE GRANDMOTHER GO SIX MONTHS IN IS BETTER THAN ANY SPOT TREATMENT AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CAN COMPETE WITH IT IT IS A ROOM FULL OF WOMEN AND MEN WHO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF OUR PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL AND THAT INCLUDES RUNNING FOR OFFICE, RUNNING CAMPAIGNS, STANDING UP AND BEING AN ADVOCATE, THEN EMILY'S LIST HAS BEEN ON THE TRACK FOR 30 YEARS AND HOPE 100 MORE UNTIL WE ARE NO LONGER NEEDED. [APPLAUSE]
<br><br>
Now, I WANT TO ANSWER ONE QUESTION AT THE START BEFORE IT STIRS UP TWITTER. PEOPLE HAVE READ A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS INTO MY PANT SUITS. DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK, THIS OUTFIT ACTUALLY IS NOT WHITE AND GOLD. I MUST SAY THAT GAVE US ALL A LITTLE BIT OF AMUSEMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR DAYS AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE I'VE BEEN WITH WHO HAVE HELD UP THE PICTURES AND ASKED ME BLUE AND BLACK, WHITE AND GOLD. I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION. THE INTERNET IS A GREAT ENABLER BUT IT'S NICE TO BE WITH PEOPLE THAT SEE WHAT IS BEFORE US AS A COUNTRY AND THAT ARE COMMITTED TO MAKE THIS A FAIR OR JUST BETTER PLACE FOR OUR GIRLS AND BOYS.
<br><br>
<span class="soundcite selected" data-id="195210534" data-start="0" data-end="63117" data-plays="1">I WANT TO START BY THANKING STEPHANIE. FIRST UP WAS AN AMAZING SPEECH. I AM SO IMPRESSED AND PROUD. [APPLAUSE] AND THE FACT THAT SHE COULD GET MY FRIENDS OF DECADES ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON A PATIENT STEPHANIE IS, BUT SHE HAS LED THIS INDISPENSABLE ORGANIZATION INTO THE 21ST CENTURY WITH SUCH SAVVY AND CLASS. SHE TOOK THE BATON AND SHE HAS RAN FASTER AND FARTHER THAN WE COULD HAVE HOPED GROWING FROM 400,000 MEMBERS TO MORE THAN 3 MILLION TODAY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP, EMILY'S LIST IS BIGGER, STRONGER, YOUNGER AND MORE DIVERSE THAN EVER. [APPLAUSE]</span>
														
													

<br><br>
SO THIS ANNIVERSARY IS A CHANCE TO CELEBRATE HOW FAR WE HAVE COME TOGETHER AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND WHY IT MATTERS NOT JUST FOR WOMEN BUT FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY I HAVE TO CONFESS SOMETIMES IDEAL FEEL LIKE A BROKEN RECORD SAYING THAT. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME PEOPLE THAT ROLL THEIR EYES WHEN I OR OTHERS SAY THAT WOMEN'S ISSUES ARE AMERICA'S ISSUES BUT THEY JUST HAVE TO GET USED TO IT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR WOMEN IN POLITICS BEFORE EMILY'S LIST. IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE PLAYING FIELD WASN'T LEVEL. WHEN MEN WERE BARELY IN THE GAME. THEY COULDN'T EVEN GET INTO THE ARENA WHERE IT WAS BEING PLAYED.
<br><br>
AND THAT'S THE GENIUS THAT INSPIRED ELLEN WHO DECIDED TO SHAKE THINGS UP. ON THAT DAY IN 1985 WHEN SHE GATHERED THOSE FRIENDS IN HER BASEMENT, NONE OF THEM COULD HAVE KNOWN EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THEY WOULD HAVE. BUT THEY DID KNOW SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. THEY KNEW THAT WHEN WOMEN PARTICIPATE IN POLITICS THE EFFECTS RIPPLE OUT FAR AND WIDE AND THEY KNOW THE COUNTRY IS FULL OF BRILLIANT TALENTED WOMEN READY TO STEP UP AND LEAD AND WHO BETTER TO PROVE THAT DAN A 4-FOOT 11-INCH SPARKPLUG NAMED BARBARA MIKULSKI.
